            <h2>Welcome! Thanks for interviewing with Transcarent!</h2>
            <p>
              We're going to work with some trees today. Our goal with this
              exercise isn't to "stump" anyone with tricky business, but to give
              candidates a fair and uniform way to express themselves in code on
              a realistic-ish problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an hour, we expect everyone will get some of the way through
              this problem, and no one will get all the way through. If invited
              to an on-site interview, you'll pair with us wherever you left
              off, because we'd much rather see how you work on a problem you're
              familiar with and have had time to think about than on some clever
              whiteboard puzzle we spring on you.
            </p>
            <p>At this stage, we care most about:</p>
            <ul>
